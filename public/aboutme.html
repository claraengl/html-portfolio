<h1>About Me and the course I want to teach </h1>
<p>I am a Spanish teacher who wants to teach Spanish to English speaking people and English to Spanish speakers.</p>

<p>I want to teach using a revolutionary approach that uses different teaching tools
    to make it easy and practical to learn the target language. One of those tools is a dice game to learn
    vocabulary and conjugation. Another important teaching strategy is a virtual teacher who interacts with students
    all the time during the learning process. To practice reading, the student will listen to the teacher reading a paragraph, 
    or excerpt; then, the student will imitate the reading. For writing practices, the student will create and write questions 
    and answers helping themselves with grammar charts and step by step instructions. To practice speaking, the person will answer
    questions that the virtual teacher will ask, so the student and the virtual teacher will have conversations.</p>

<p>Assessment will be an important way for the student to evaluate his process. Writing practices will be graded according to 
    a system that will check for the accuracy of grammar and spelling rules. For Speaking and pronunciation practices, the tool
    will be the voice recognition tool. When the student is reading, the voice recognition will write
    what the student is reading. While the student is pronouncing the words, the voice recognition 
    tool will reproduce the reading parragraph and grade it. The same will apply to answering questions for 
    speaking practice exercises. In this way, the student will be able to know his progress and to realize the need to repeat the 
    lesson in order to learn.</p>

    <p>There is an award system based on goal learning tasks. That system will be the guidence for grading and passing the course.
        It also determines the need of the student to repeat the course in part or totally. A reaching goal grade of 68% or less will
        be the basis to repeat the course. A grade of 69 to 76% will be passing, 77 to 84% will be a passing grade with a 
        bronze medal, 85 to 92% will be a passing grade with a silver medal, and 93 to 100% will be a passing grade with a gold medal.</p>
